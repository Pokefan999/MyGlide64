# MyGlide64
This is a personal project and a hobby that I started in early 2011.
It is a gfx plugin as part of my new N64 emulator project 1964mod because of a lack of new public release by existing emulators. It becomes the standard default gfx plugin for subsequent N64 emulator projects, NICE64, ICE64, STX64 and ACE64.
It started out as a private interest to help Gonetz Glide64 project as a tester but that project ended in Dec 2011. That project ignites my interest to start my own N64 project and MyGlide64 will end with ACE64 when both reaches v10.
